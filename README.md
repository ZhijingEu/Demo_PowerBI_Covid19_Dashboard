# Demo_PowerBI_Covid19_Dashboard
This is a demo dashboard built using data from ECDC website and Yahoo Finance (for market data) that looks at plotting Major Stock Exchange and COVID Case numbers side by side. 

The report also allows end users to interact with sliders to create estimates of case numbers using Logistic Growth curve model and also SIR Model (unfortunately, because the SIR Model was built using Python Visuals and I do not have a Pro License, you have to download the PBIX file locally to view it) 

There is a walk through of how it was built here :- https://medium.com/@zhijingeu/building-publishing-a-dashboard-online-with-ms-power-bi-a1f76997e114?source=friends_link&sk=4299ca742707f79825f68f485be38d03
